I am a postdoctoral researcher specializing in data-driven materials science (materials informatics) in Max-Planck Institute, Düsseldorf. Before that, I obtained my PhD degree in computational materials from Ruhr-Universität Bochum. My research interests include: applying machine learning and mathematical modeling to solve data-related problems in materials science; developing new methods and algorithms for important open problems which the existing methods cannot solve.
