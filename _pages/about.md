I am a postdoctoral research data scientist in Max-Planck Institute, Düsseldorf. Before that, I obtained my PhD degree in computer simulations of materials from Ruhr-Universität Bochum. My research interests include: applying machine learning to solve data-related problems in materials science; developing new methods and algorithms for important scientific problems which the existing methods cannot solve.
