## Introduction
The α (bcc) - γ (fcc) - δ (bcc) phase transitions make iron quite unique among all
elements in the periodic table. In our work, we first calculate the electronic (magnetic) contribution by performing a thermodynamic integration for the magnetic degrees of freedom from bcc to fcc iron. After that we calculate the vibrational contribution and treat the effect
of spin fluctuations on atomic vibrations with the spin-space averaging scheme as this method has been proven valid for calculations of magnon-phonon coupling
in iron. We finally obtain the total free-energy difference by summing up the two contributions, and show that the combined effect of the two contributions
leads to α (bcc) - γ (fcc) - δ (bcc) in iron.

## Conclusion
At low-temperature region (T < 900 K), the gain of the exchange energy due to the
ferromagnetic ordering significantly lowers the internal energy in bcc iron, and the
electronic contribution plays a dominant role in determining the total free-energy
difference. At high-temperature region (T > 900 K), the electronic contribution
decreases to the same energy scale with that of the vibrational contribution, and
the competition between the two contributions leads to the α (bcc) - γ (fcc) -
δ (bcc) phase transitions. our calculated total free-energy difference is in overall good
agreement with the CALPHAD data
