## Introduction
The α (bcc) - γ (fcc) - δ (bcc) phase transitions make iron quite unique among all
elements in the periodic table and attract many theoretical calculations. In our work, we first calculate the electronic (magnetic) contribution by performing a thermodynamic integration for the magnetic degrees of freedom from bcc to fcc iron. After that we calculate the vibrational contribution and treat the effect
of spin fluctuations on atomic vibrations with the spin-space averaging scheme as this method has been proven valid for calculations of magnon-phonon coupling
in iron. We finally obtain the total free-energy difference by summing up the two contributions, and show that the combined effect of the two contributions
leads to α (bcc) - γ (fcc) - δ (bcc) in iron.
