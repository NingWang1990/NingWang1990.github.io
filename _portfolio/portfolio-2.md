## Introduction
We present an unsupervised machine learning approach for segmentation of atomic-resolution
microscopy images and videos. We combine symmetry-based local descriptors with classical unsupervised machine learning algorithms and highlight that the microscopy images might be segmented in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate in this paper the successful application to the high-angle
annular dark-field scanning Transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images with atomic
resolution. We release our code as a python module that reads the microscopy images and outputs
the labels for all pixels, which is flexible to be used either as a standalone python code or as a plugin
to other microscopy packages.
