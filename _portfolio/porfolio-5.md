## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”. As the core of AI, the application of machine learning has gone beyond industry
and drives a new way for researchers to extract physical laws or knowledge from experiments or simulations. In computational materials science, a well-known
problem is to construct the structure-energy relationship, i.e., to calculate the potential energy for a given atomic or magnetic configuration. Machine-learning is
playing an increasing role in this problem as the trained machine-learning models can save orders of magnitudes in computational cost of electronic-structure models
(ESM) such as DFT, tight-binding, or bond-order potentials, and make it possible to perform large-scale simulations. For non-magnetic materials, there
have already been many machine-learning models available, e.g., Gaussian approximation potentials, neural-network potentials and moment tensor
potentials. However, for magnetic materials, the machine-learning models are still in infancy. As a first step to develop machine-learning approaches for
magnetic materials, we propose in this work a neural-network potential for magnetic systems with homogeneous atomic environment. Furthermore, we employ
a perturbation approach to correct the error in the thermodynamic calculations with the machine-learning model.
